# RPG1 - js_rpg1

Welcome to the RPG1 project! This repository serves as a foundation for creating a role-playing game (RPG) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While inspired by a tutorial, I am modifying and expanding upon the concepts presented to make this project my own over time.

## Introduction

In this project, I aim to create a unique RPG experience, potentially about pizza chefs, but the theme may evolve as development progresses. The repository is named "RPG1" to maintain a level of vagueness at this stage. This project is built upon a tutorial, and I encourage you to explore and adapt the concepts covered here to suit your own vision.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tutorial provides a great starting point, and I will be modifying it to add my own features and mechanics.

## Features

- **Classic RPG Mechanics**: Implement turn-based battles, character progression, and exploration.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify and expand the game to include new features and mechanics as development continues.
- **Unique Theme**: Explore the potential of a pizza chef-themed RPG, or let the theme evolve as the project progresses.
